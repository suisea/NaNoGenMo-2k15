you

       So leave me in the splash 
      I want you so much
       But I 
hate 
          you dare look 
      back
      Walk away you just 
escaped
   
         Push me in 
the frost
Then leave me 
   in the cold
Wait until 
the cold
         Wait until 
this is torturous 
     'cause 
      this 
      is torturous electricity
Between both of us 
and 
this is torturous 
electricity
Between both of us
And 
this 
is torturous electricity
Between 
          both of us and 
      think about this is torturous electricity
Between 
          the choices that 
you dare look back
Walk 
      away
      Leave 
me 
       in the 
dirt pit
Don't this is
Dangerous electricity
          Between 
   the this is torturous electricity
Between the consequences
Though
