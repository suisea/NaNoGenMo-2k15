to climb out

i 
      think 
         i’d 
die 
    before i destroyed my 
theme songs 
remind 
    me of this 
   troubles me.

    i think i’d die 
    before i became 
More of a well of 
self-hatred i'dn’t encountered since 
        i was suicidal i’ve started to do 
with the mind and i realised we

die 
  even
         26

   life is long, or longer belief given how 
       suicidal i’ve been 
reading 
steve roggenbuck but the childlike quality 
of 
   strange too emotional 
       too serious 
too intense too 
emotional too serious too 
much, too powerful for 
       an overground 
the 
       ocean before i destroyed my theme songs remind me 
on that made 
    me 
    feel 
   like a 
parasite newborn human 
being 
gender 
if you the songs during playback 
and 
ever be able to ourself out enough space 
          on being 
genderwear 
on the burger place and 
you were no lyrics and the weight of on the 
      main character 
back to me 
they 
          like a 
  white 
women thought up 
to 
conceptualise its unreality. you replied it’s my last times i think about 
        that when i’m sad. miracles the party 
and motivated 
and be white, male point if you 
       to be
if 
only 
      computer of steve roggenbuck but that months i’ve recovered from san diego to 
         say 
    what the weight 
of survive this 
was because i think about how 
        telling you 
         how that 
the 
  café where is in 
life

      honestly
      
         i wore 
my understand human 
      being 
me 
      a sunflower than live 
the 
   weight of on the 
sidewalk charging my own 
worlds collide 
    and 
     you 
were
   being me a sunflower than 
four 
years. (i know her anyway. recognise?)

midnight city, midnight city, midnight city, 
    midnight i drove home screamed.
one nightmare
so 
realised 
we all the sidewalk 
      charging my wallet 
        again and think about 
food and now it sucked 
to be
      if only comprehensible 
     thing.

         horrible things
but that i’ve forgotten what 
     does any of us 
       even tell you yet. 
    i found
     an errant crescent moon between songs and 
       think that’s the heaviness 
of 
      what you think

      i know why just 
as 
     scared and all times. i started to be
if 
      only 
     thing about food 
and
       how fucked up. i walked around 
      the childlike quality of 
  steve 
    roggenbuck 
      but the 
childlike quality of steve 
roggenbuck but that’s the point 
         is midnight city, 
midnight 
city, midnight city, 
midnight i 
         had 
to pick 
him up 
before i destroyed my 
nanowrimo 
goal which 
i’d 
   written from san diego to 
sad songs that it was in JFK 
       i wanted to 
driven on that made me feel 
        better.
