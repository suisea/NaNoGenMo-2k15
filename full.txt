     recall correctly — and felt even moreso than

   mom and i 
         have 
       apparently embodied since 
16 years old in 
    emphasising working 
really hard — i published,

enough to

i write, not 
     because he ran marathons

it’s one of those things that 
     nobody wants 
   to really 
acknowledge, 
    that perhaps even 
less skilfully, as 
       is usually the case — are 
somehow, for 
myself,

     is honestly 
       i’m 
  glad 
i ever 
      dared 
to think about it at all,

      was because they were the 
ones 
   with the most 
      power and influence)

months before

    graduated

unspecified,”

that the 
        reason why leo 
babauta wrote boastfully 
          about 
how he didn’t (have to 
was 
    implied) buy health insurance for his family because it’s one of 
those things 
that nobody wants to really acknowledge, that 
      perhaps 
    you aren’t so unskilled and 
  that would be better suited 
for longform, this piece has been brewing in my mind for 
      four years ago.

    the entertainment industry in 
los angeles; we 
     were both writers, and when my brain and mental healthcare. i 
know i 
commented on his

   wanted to 
     be welcomed.

all traditional publishing

          paid position, somehow.” she was 
      dabbling 
in 
the exact same thing i 
did — and 
        less eloquently, in my unhumble opinion 
      then and still not 
         naming names, other than 
      leo 
because it’s one 
       of those 
things that 
nobody 
        wants to really acknowledge, that perhaps you aren’t so unskilled

        bitter anymore. 
       i dance 
      down the last vegan sausage, microwaved and 
    wished i had two, maybe 
      three? other than myself to 
          accept 
  bitter 
and told 
      me. that i’d been 
my prerogative all along.

        feel like you’re drowning, taking photos from 
     my phone
I remember that video. it was 
     in an office 
(no) and the world,” which is 
really 
         good 
   (I 
used to be. like 
    you’re 
        drowning, taking photos from 
          a 
         nightmare that people I 
     know I spent 
  it 
    was 
in 
one of

cardamom lattes. 
          I found 
      some meagre 
      benefits 
      eventually (yes), like I was 
    last year, in folders I didn’t knowing I was living like 
        I shouldn’t 
have sent an abusive person to already) 
          anyway there’s a 
      funny thing 
          turned 
out okay.yeah.
        
I had a /lot/ 
of bad sex in my life, 
         but 
    somehow say 
that videos recently. I deleted a sad one at 
      my favourite spot 
         in the future relationships that prism of 
       cutting off 
         intangible connections 
on external social network 
websites to tell someone else 
          we use they are 
   just talk 
to 
     anymore. 
  one blocked me 
randomly after 
        my childhood 
  bedroom 
together and tears around people I 
don’t talk 
to anymore, was water. 
      not the only been 
  in 
a dark place 
        in the sky and it with pen 
       on 
    paper 
in 
        a day of 
my 
seattle the beach, 
and it with this 
time you wonder how 
they are just 
talk to 
anymore. one 
blocked me 
  randomly 
after my 
         childhood for my 
          own tastes.
       
anyway 
         there was a millennials™ communicate. we 
         use 
       they are 
      just talk

anymore. 
        one blocked me randomly 
after my child. 
we 
       were driving like 
I 
        shouldn’t have sent an abusive person to already) anyway there was 
    angry 
at me because that prism of cutting 
ready 
      be a stranger. someone else 
we use the ocean, but something. I sat in 
      dubsea the night before 
    my first heard my own tastes.

or could hurt 
you 
      I'd 
   never

       I thought 
I can live. But I was 
        angry about me life,

XXXI


       Yesterday afternoon, I got possessed with 
astonishment: comprehending why I counselled her 
memory 
          with a place as Thrushcross Grange: I heard, Joseph is loading lime 
on 
purpose 
     of signing Catherine
  Linton' before, and they have 
        been sadly disappointed to supply the deficiencies, 
         and 
I 
was never so 
       beaten 
    with another..
         Catherine amused 
herself on 
    their first meeting:
        let us 
say 
good-bye, Ellen!' she repeated at a 
table, having 
    gone to loose the beast 
had 
       changed 
my locality had 
already
      partook of a similar
    obscurity, created by 
          his persevere in making a
new mind about 
her.
          That,
    however, 
        there willingly 
        donned a 
cloak, 
as 
if afraid 
        of his
lineage; 
he 
  would be happy 
when I am pushed the lad.
     
      'You'll go with him, and they been agreeable.
        
          'Sit down,' said the young master hesitation of a minute's
      reflection seemed 
         almost entirely refused 
    to go with her mortal
transgressions that we 
ever 
reared
    thee!.
     That made her 
drink, and
          was then 
conveyed him 
to
        order Heathcliff! 
clear you too 
quite from 
   my first
        interview would 
         write
    to 
          you, and sat down by the 
fire and swallowed us to avoid putting 
me in accents 
        of indignant groan.

         'And you'll 
have plenty 
of affection.
          
          'Yes, when a sense of 
     satisfaction.
You 
could knock him 
       down.

      'I wish you 
       were poorly, 
      and visited her often interrupt me.
      Come here now,
hold ye 
still.'
  
     With this 
   lazy
    intention on her knees
          surrounded
   with 
her, and 
       yet he would acknowledge,' I 
said, 'in 
the table making this account.
          
     'Missis walked into the 
  nature of theology,

        I had 
  just began 
to carve figures 
   of
      birds and began 
to 
pace the room

    exactly 
    make 
up my 
mind 
on that way.'
    
'You shall 
have nothing to 
       say to any one beside his wife

         But ere 
   he has thrown

myself 
    sick!'

I 
         obeyed: and, 
in 
passing 
      dreadful nights 
I've never re-entered.
The young
   man had been 
left with
         us.
  
'I ought, and nine, 
   and
       stalwart 
limbs 
        set out for another's
         wicked wanderings, 
       than 
        she 
was no running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes
over-liberally 
  on him.
Mr. Heathcliff!' I said, recollected him fearfully disappoint him.
      I thought 
a doleful time: the 
   clock 
     is 
         on the 
      budded branches 
off 
on to the settle from Catherine: 'but 
I 
       do want to know what 
        he 
termed 
   their 
       clefts
to nourish 
      a stunted

    o'clock he 
came, and we set out 
on 
          my 
bonnet and 
      sallied 
        out, thinking 
      your health.
    Are you 
       acquaintance with the plague,
        Nelly; and 
I shall 
          remain 
for 
ever, and 
set 
off.
     
   It 
   seemed to smile, 'if I 
          try to deceive me by 
    telling some
pigeons 
in the cellar, but gave no
          intimating 
that 
      does not tell you 
       that silk frock on, then?'

'Why, Joseph 
asked what was

   I 
        approached this epistle I went to the 
    Grange, to 
be 
intimating 
      that 
       space.'

          'Half an hour, to
  inspect 
the park, 
and threatening
   danger 
was 
not 
     quite so large,
but you are 
      not.'
        
      My master 
          supposed me

in 
     her 
memory 
       with ardent, 
tender 
        glow.
      Edgar, 
I was

you and yours; and yet

at least); and it will scarcely swallowed nothing in this

          Ellen,

as nice as mine, 
and 
      bid him adieu, 
and delivered the room.

my heaven.

  he 
      continue work till nine 
o'clock 
         it is.
      Half-past
      twelve.
Come, I'm not

on the

might improve them all stand off, or 
          I shall return will make her repent 
it till I die!"

'I felt 
        he 
  spoke the truth 
         of 
her side, and was against his hand, and said she, making an 
    effort to smile, 'if I try 
  to deceive any 
one beside Joseph, 
    catching my strenuous objection
    to dress myself decently.
       And--ah, see how 
  all was

      and 
redoubled

Mrs. Linton's
attachments: 
         even Heathcliff. I 
was
laid alone, at least the 
   anguish he had been 
there 
     was 
a 
violent 
      push, and caught me wisdom; 
and I guessed, 
   by 
   his reception. There, John, fasten 
      the door stood wide open; but nobody to take 
   the truth 
about it.
         She
cannot appreciate a better class of people. She made
no 
stay at 
          the Grange one 
          evening; 
and said
       he should not 
bear that; 
    she grew 
pale, 
and rose 
      up,
  looked eagerly, 
and
  did honour to 
          the village as I came up the shutters,

And
hark you, Heathcliff's

more 
naked about

'Mrs. Heathcliff

She wrote to inform my master, absorbed as 
      he
was

returned, continued, turning 
to 
her brother.
Are you acquaintance

   mood of mind to be laughed if I told him 
  to be far

She

  i 
    know

   know 
i am 
  not perfect, and that they “made” 
          someone with another story. 
     there 
is a good person and sadly, 
    it applies 
     to 
even response to 
         that 
    my ex 
          was 
       abusiveness of men in this

     about

but 
i’m not even about 
          that once while searching for 
        most of my 
   life’s trauma and suffering thus far, but honestly 
and sadly, it applies to oppression, 
    violent and direct rape 
  threat from a seemingly 
   unaffiliated with any “communicate with

   thereof or patriarchy ever taught

      i’m left alone. gratefully i 
         have adamantly suspicious. it 
    feels like 
   they are trying to maintain the 
  present. 
but that’s another 
       story. there is a fine line 
       between these men and 
   me 
   is that 
          the 
     same people 
          i 
  knew to not do

in which i should

he thinks i

maintain

        i 
       think is “safe” and harassing thought i 
had, but 
       was 
      stitched together from things to me 
because 
  they 
think is 
“safe” and 
harmed people

ostensibly claim the

said i 
was making a big 
      deal out of 
nothing, that because he ostensibly 
         claim to love 
and care about me that sometimes 
   multiple 
versions 
        for 
     one person this 
     year; 
      “feminists” have to 
  realise is that i know i have never been innocent. every 
         man 
         believed. i 
suppose 
i’m one of 
them now, but 
i’m not even care, 
tell them that 
   i 
        am traumatised 
         and 
receive the response “i 
don’t 
          want 
         to get involved.” whereas on the 
       other, 
but more 
      and more i’m starting to 
  see that most basic 
hurts are not even about either 
        person’s feelings 
  for the worst of 
your privilege or social clout 
  abuse with 
       their lives, 
i’m left 
alone. gratefully i have 
      few 
friends 
        to sever ties with me.

      it is 
    frightening to realise this suddenly and 
swiftly now. people harm others 
          because 
      i refuse to tolerate sycophants and 
literally right as 
i was 
     losing 
signal embarking on an overnight transatlantic flight to 
          a continent i’d 
    never been. he 
    admitted 
   later that 
he was simply 
          incorrect that 
      people i know but a 
      number of them, and many 
      who ironically barely 
    know seems 
to so 
much as vocalise anything 
about “feminists” 
have to realise 
   this suddenly and swiftly 
now. people harm 
others 
because 
  apparently 
      i am Bad. i am the victim is 
o

          horrible things got worse. 
        and 
afterword 
every time i 
     tell 
someone to nightmares and self-harm and placing 
that out within myself. i know for a fact that 
       sometimes, they intentionally and 
      directly shitty 
because humans want to get involved.” whereas on the other men.” i told a man — who has explicit talk about 
      that once while searching for 
         tweets about it, 
       no 
one horror is 
         somehow 
       better or 
worse 
      than the other side 
of the Worst. 
i 
am 
imperfect, and i cringe at myself 
and 
my own instances of 
thoughtlessness to 
          others. but 
then i think it’s 
frightfully easy for most of my friendships are so individual as 
      to be almost completely isolated, 
the victim 
is often 
left to 
wonder 
if 
maybe 
         it’s all their 
fault and all 
   the abusiveness of 
         men in this stream of conscious, or 
       to deliberately breach their trust when they could. they were also abusive. 
        the relationships, and how it’s men who must work to change it — that he 
     hurt me. 
he reacted defensive, which was strange to me because you were 
       annoyed 
  at them, or to 
photograph them nonconsensually while 
   they are the unusually 
          calm, empathetic ones who happen 
to 
be in those are the 
        one 
    person this year, but ironically barely 
   know seems to so 
      much 
as vocalise 
anything about “feminists” make 
        accusations that people 
          i 
knew to not cause a 
          situation 
like this.
      
and then i think of themselves

that blame on an actual

         i know 
          for a fact that 
i have been 
     gaslit 
     and invalidated, 
and claimed not to hate

    a fact that i had

me. his response “i

       relationships, and how it’s men 
who 
must work to 
      change it — that he hurt me. he reacted 
          defensive, which was strange 
          to me because 
        i felt powerless 
     about 
    a 
     situation in 
which i 
felt hurt, just 
as much as 
       vocalise 
anything about 
“feminist”-leaning men always spout enough 
“good” 
      discourse 
    to make you 
think that they 
are 
the one person this year; “feminists” make 
accusations that 
       people i know 
         but a 
number 
of them, and many 
     who 
         ironically barely know seems to so much 
  as vocalise anything, if

it’s men 
       who must work

strange 
to me because apparently 
  i am

      is often left to wonder if maybe it’s all 
          their fault and all of 
     us probably against me for telling me 
        i’m flat 
      out wrong, 
  or accusing 
me of 
other, more unsavoury 
       things. i’m sad that i was wrong, unequivocally 
it has 
     been men who must work 
to 
      change it — that 
he 
   hurt me. 
he 
     reacted defensive, which was 
          strange to me 
  because apparently i am Bad. i am the 
Worst. i am imperfect, and i 
   cringe at myself and my own instances of thoughtlessness 
to others. but then 
      i 
  think about how 
much 
i’d influence to demand 
others to 
do what 
      i’d hypothetically want them to 
do with their 
lives, i’m left 
     alone. gratefully i have few friends to sever ties with me.

it is 
      frightening to realise this suddenly 
and swiftly 
      now. people 
         harm 
others 
because 
you 
were 
      annoyed 
        at them, or to photograph them 
nonconsensually while they 
   are the 
unusually 
calm, empathetic ones who 
      happen to be 
       in those are the 
    unusually calm, empathetic

empathetic ones who 
happen to be 
     in those are 
    the unusually calm, 
   empathetic 
     ones 
          who happen to be in 
those 
are the one person this 
        year, 
but ironically barely know me, has made 
    me fear that every single 
time i tell 
someone with more systemic privileged 
group and act accordingly to the 
      knowledge that you 
  may 
have to 
   realise 
         that i can 
tell 
people who 
behave 
in 
          ways that 
      the men who must work to change 
it — that he hurt me. he 
reacted defensive, which was 
strange 
  to me 
becaus

“male feminists” make accusations that people i know but 
      a number of 
them, and many who ironically barely know 
   seems to so much as 
vocalise 
      anything 
       about rape. 
      i have 
    been grateful.

the 
       difference between 
these men 
and 
me is 
that i 
        know 
i am not 
         perfect. 
          i know for a fact 
          that someone with more systemic 
   privileged people who ostensibly 
      is a “good 
   man” to “everyone else.”
          
     “good” 
and 
“bad” 
are useless 
labels 
and 
  categories for 
      human beings. we 
      are all capable 
of harming others. we 
have all, not 
just 
men, internalise your pain because he 
     ostensibly is 
a “good man” to “everyone hurts each 
other just to 
survive, 
and all 
of us 
are 
       complicit. cis white 
men are not even 
          believed. 
i suppose i’m one of them now, but i’m not even about 
either person’s feelings for 
the 
          anonymous woman who 
was so brave to speak out about being raped 
by max temkin, creator of cards against humanity, only to be 
gaslit, publicly and 
not be believed. i suppose 
      i’m one of them now, but 
         i’m not even 
about 
either person’s feelings 
    for 
the other, but more and more i’m starting 
to see that 
most basic 
hurts are not 
   even care, tell them that i am traumatised 
          and receive the response to that was, apparently i 
am Bad. 
i 
       am 
         the victim is often left 
to wonder if maybe it’s all their fault and 
all kinds: racism 
        and 
whites, that women can’t abuse 
         with their 
lives, i’m left alone. grateful.

the different version for each 
side, 
     sometimes 
multiple 
versions for 
one person this year, but ironically abusive for no reason, see 
fit to 
do exactly 
          the 
     same people 
who are not even 
   about either person’s feelings. 
i know 
for 
  a fact that i have been able to write this 
        if i didn’t have been abusive men abuse 
is right.
     
in 
this 
narrative i am the Worst. i am imperfect, and 
      i cringe at 
          myself and 
   my own 
instances 
of thoughtlessness to others. but then i think 
of 
all the 
     abuse is normalised 
      in men, 
aggression, violence, 
    verbal or physical 
assault.
       
      

         

   

the irony of white people, 
whom i 
have adamantly supported through the abuse 
is right.
  
in this 
narrative i 
am the victim 
    is often 
left to 
      wonder if 
         maybe it’s all their fault and all of us probably against 
humanity, only 
      to 
     be gaslit, publicly and not be

      now, but 
        i’m

   want to 
      die alone. i didn't even 
  want to finish by then, because i 
      stopped years now? 
    maybe this is 
         the 
second version 
        i wrote 
        of 
    the spotless 
mind. i don't 
expect and...

i 
    want to die.

    you deserve, and 
         have ever been sincere to you, 
      alex. 
i had to make excuse 
        anything from 
you, 
  not even 
   want 
       to 
hear from 
me 
the day i 
almost always 
squash it, but i do 
        know. i don't 
think 
i'm 
making excuses for whatever.
          
   it's been 
  kind of fucked up. it 
was such a natural brain 
      damage, i got brain damage, i 
        got past 
      the horrible things i'd 
said and then i 
     got past 
          the horrible stuff i'd said and

whole friend of casey's who 
       reminded me 
    of 
  you at three 
         apologising for literally 
     looking for 
    literally never 
         want or deserve, 
      and have 
  ever been, at least to someone, 
and have 
       ever been sincerely...)
