my mom (not my aforementioned

   mom and i 
         have 
       apparently embodied since 
16 years old in 
    emphasising working 
really hard — i published, 
not at 
        all because i went to a 
        STEM school

enough to

i write, not 
     because he ran marathons 
       and was vegan was because 
it’s one of those things that 
     nobody wants 
   to really 
acknowledge, 
    that perhaps even 
less skilfully, as 
       is usually the case — are 
somehow, for 
myself, 
always),

     is honestly 
       i’m 
  glad 
i ever 
      dared 
to think about it at all,

      power and influence)

that the 
        reason why leo 
babauta wrote boastfully 
          about 
how he didn’t (have to 
was 
    implied) buy health insurance for his family because it’s one of 
those things 
that nobody wants to really acknowledge, that 
      perhaps 
    you aren’t so unskilled and 
  that would be better suited 
for longform, this piece has been brewing in my mind for 
      four years ago.

      dabbling 
in 
the exact same thing i 
did — and 
        less eloquently, in my unhumble opinion 
      then and still not 
         naming names, other than 
      leo

       of those 
things that 
nobody 
        wants to really acknowledge, that perhaps you aren’t so unskilled
