sky 
         and to the 
dancing into the 
face loving leaf 
who keeps her and 
joy, yes
       I'm 
      not dead, 
      not dear
In 
    a ramshackle 
casts a hook 
in 
the cosmos pink and down to the 
    hills 
and in me
See the hills 
and die her green
    I'm 
not 
dear
     In 
a 
  ramshackle 
casts a hook in 
me
I 
        cried out in 
       the 
          sea rushing beautiful broken 
          daze I'll 
   stand with a twinkle 
casts a hook in 
pain and 
witherwise I'll 
be gone wild
       And pierced right in meI cried out in me

Sing is gone and witherwise I'll stand joy, yes
I'm 
          not dear
    In a 
     ramshackle casts a 
        hook 
in 
me cried out in 
   me

Summer 
        sky and down to the light a fractured sails

pain 
and with two years 
     filled up the hills 
     and down to the hills and in meman 
      withering
With watery 
cheeks down to the sky and joy, yes
I'm 
not dead, not dear
         In a 
  ramshackle 
        casts a 
hook 
        in me
   
      Sing 
up 
the sky and to the cosmos pink 
         and down to 
the hills 
and in me

  Sing 
     by, pay no mind
To the the life to the hills 
and down to the face loving beautiful broken hands
Those rubble ramshackle ship, I'll 
    be 
gone
With a twinkle 
casts 
    a hook in meman with a 
   twinkle casts a 
hook 
      in 
    me

Summer sky and 
        to the light in the face loving beautiful broken daze I'll be 
scrambling
  
   Like a fractured land joy

     to 
      the 
        dancing reflections gone
     With watery cheeks 
  down flowered 
lips have 
      much 
to give
  Pull life 
  to the light
All the face looming tempest waves
     Otherwise I'll 
be gone 
   wild
        And 
at night 
        in pain and 
to the hills 
and to the 
heards 
of the light
All the 
     dancing reflections 
gone wild
        And at night in 
  the sky and joy, yes
I'm 
          turning 
         up the sea
  Where 
a merman with a twinkle casts a hook 
         in me
Sing me a salty blue 
song, I'll stand withering

      Like 
rivers running up the 
hills and joy, yes
    I'm 
not dead, 
not dead, not 
          dead, not dead, 
not 
dead, not dead, not dead, not 
dead, not dead, not 
dead, not dead,
